Interesting week. Each exercise was challenging, twitter account was locked due to my several attempts to receive a verification code, which i never got. 
Unfortunately I am faced with the technological down falls that accompany living in the middle of no where in manitoba, this was very apparent this week. 
I felt defeated a few times, but eventually the wins beat out the fails. Of course i could not complete all of the exercises due to tech error, and my poor time managment. 
Now i know for next week how to spread out the work load, cramming this is not enjoyable and leads to fustration.
